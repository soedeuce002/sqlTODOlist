Using the todolist database from the previous project, write another set of SQL statements in a file called todo2.sql.

Write INSERT statements to insert 20 todos into the todos table, with a combination of priorities, created times, and completed times, with not all having a completed time.
Write a SELECT statement to find all incomplete todos with priority 3.
Write a SELECT statement to find the number of incomplete todos by priority.
Write a SELECT statement to find the number of todos by priority created in the last 30 days.
Write a SELECT statement to find the next todo you should work on. This is the todo with the highest priority that was created first.
